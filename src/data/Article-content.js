      `MERN is one of several variations of the MEAN stack (MongoDB Express Angular Node), where the traditional Angular.js frontend framework is replaced with React.js. Other variants include MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node), and really any frontend JavaScript framework can work.
      MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.
      MongoDB - document database
      Express(.js) - Node.js web framework
      React(.js) - a client-side JavaScript framework
      Node(.js) - the premier JavaScript web server.
      Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.`,

      `ReactJS is a declarative, efficient JavaScript framework to build interactive user interfaces (UI) with greater ease and flexibility. It provides many advantages in designing simple views for different states in an application and greater ease in updating and rendering the right components efficiently just when the data changes.
      React JS is a very competent dynamic application for preparing larger web apps in a coordinated, flexible way where application UIs can be designed in a scalable and swift manner.
      React is winning the hearts as a solid front-end development application due to its flexibility, better performance, and enhanced usability features to use the applications on both clients as well as the server-side.
      Also, the’ Similar tech’ survey report suggests that the “United States of America” is the front-runner worldwide in hiring react developers for many future projects along with present ventures.`,

      `Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.
      We all have hopes, dreams, and plans for the future. Whether you’re looking for a new opportunity, want to optimize your current job, or are simply searching for a new hobby, coding can help you get closer to your goals. And remember, anyone can learn how to code!
      Computer and information technology jobs are growing incredibly fast in the United States and across the globe. You don't need a Computer Science degree; there are more and more high-paying jobs emerging every day for newer learners like you.`,

      `These both look like they are pointing towards the same thing. But really it doesn’t mean it, they are two different terms for a software developer who actually works with real-world problems. 
      In real Programming is a superset of Coding. That means every element of Coding is a part of Programming. A lot of debates and discussions had happened on this topic as they both have their separate fan base among IT workers. Some love coding while others are interested in programming. But these two are interlinked with each other which made the most important for developing potential software in IT.
      Programming defines as a set of instructions to some device for performing tasks on behalf of a human for doing them. This is not that easy to provide those instructions as you listen. Actually there is a lot of stuff happening behind such as working with Algorithm, Memory management Tasks, Testing, Debugging and a lot to know.
      Coding is totally different from programming. It is all about doing a translator job between different programming languages. They convert the code of one language to another without changing any logic and instructions in it. Generally, it’s a hard job and at the same time, it’s boring too. `,

      `When it comes to the stylized art and NPR tool for Blender, the Toonkit for cycles comes at the top. But the problem is it is for Cycles Node System are is paid to use. Not everyone can afford Toonkit. 
            To solve this problem the Beer is made. `,
      `BEER stands for Blender Extended Expressive Renderer which is a free and open-source real-time non-photo real (NPR) rendering engine. The real goal of BEER is about the ability to EXTEND a render engine all the time. The nature of non-photo real (NPR) is one that is never settled. There will always be someone creating something epic that they want to share with everyone. The ability to add that shader and remix it with other NPR features will generate endless styles.`,
      `Unlike in PBR, in NPR there are no rights or wrongs. There are as many NPR techniques and workflows as art styles one can imagine, so our renderer backend must be easy to extend, customize and experiment with.`,
